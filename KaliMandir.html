     <p id="f1">Located on the Sasaram-Aara road near the local bus stand, the temple of Kali is the center of faith for the people of the city and surrounding areas for two hundred years. 
	 The belief among the people is that there is no empty-handed back to those who demand vows with a true heart. To whom the remote devotees come here for vows and prayers.
	 Hundreds of people are crowded every day during the worship aarti. Everyday there is a special pooja and aarti. A large number of people arrive here to join. But in Vasant,
	 Sharad Navaratri and the whole month of Savaan have begun to roam the devotees. In Saawan and Navmi, langar is offered to devotees.

	 grand statue of Mother and Pran pratishtha was done. It is said that there was a spread of cholera around 50 years ago, in which many people were killed. At the same time, a 
	 Naga Baba was passing through this path, he worshiped in the temple of Mother at the request of local people. After this the grand temple was built here. A two-floor Dharamsala 
	 has also been built to keep the devotees in the temple premises. While 40 water taps have been installed for bathing and other necessary works. RO water supply is available for 
	 the devotees to drink. In Navaratri special prayers Aarti with red chunari are also offered by devotees to the mother.
