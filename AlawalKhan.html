   <h7>Tomb of Alawal Khan</h7>
</div>  
   
      <div class="pAlawal">
      <p id="f1">The tomb of Alawal Khan is situated to the south of the town. Alawal Khan, whose full name was Allauddin Khan,
	  was the superintendent of buildings under the Pathan rulers Sher Shah and Salim Shah. He was also an important
	  general in command of 5,000 horsemen. While Alawal Khan was incharge of the construction of Sher Shah's tomb , he
	  pilfered better materials for his own tomb and was therefore put to disgrace by Sher Shah. As such, the tomb of 
	  Alawal Khan consists in plan only of a courtyard surrounded by a high stone wall of fine masonry with three 
	  entrances on the east, south and north, but now only the eastern entrance remains and the other two have been 
	  closed. The eastern and western walls are surmounted by cupolas and the principal door has some fine carvings 
	  round it. There are only three open graves inside the enclosure, one of Alawal Khan and the other two of his 
	  relatives. On the grave of Alawal Khan is a short epitaph containing the usual Kalimas.

	  </div>
	  
	  <div class="pAlawal">
	  <p id="f2">There is a large arched door in the eastern wall of the tomb. Within the door there is a 103ft square courtyard.
	  Four chambered squares are made on the four corners of the courtyard. Among these, the North-Eastern Chamber is two-storey.
	  There are only three tomb between the courtyard. The ornate arched mimber is made in the Western wall. After seeing the 
	  importance of the tomb , it was declared safe by the State Government on March 11, 1981 under Bihar's ancient monuments 
	  archaeological site and the Kalanidhi Act, 1976. But in the absence of supervision, the main courtyard of the mausoleum
	  and surrounding area is full of fluttering and garbage.

	  <div class="pAlawal">
	  <p id="f3">The tomb of Alawal Khan, built in the 16th century, is the important archaeological site of the district. Similarly, the 
	  martyr memorial with marks is a testimony to the glorious history of the immortal soldiers of 1857. But ignoring these 
	  very important heritage, there is a threat to their existence. There was no concrete work even though the tomb of Alawal
	  Khan was preserved by the government 35 years ago and the martyr's memorial with the mark 11 years ago.
