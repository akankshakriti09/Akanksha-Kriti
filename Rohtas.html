<h4>Rohtas</h4>
<p id="f1">The name of 'ROHTAS' is derived from Rohitasva (Rohtas) fort in 1972. Rohitasva was son of king Harishchandra who was ancestor of king Dasarath, father of Lord Ram.
 Rohtas has an old & interesting history. In pre-historic days the plateau region of the Rohtas has been the abode of aboriginals whose chief representatives now
 are the Bhars, the Cheers and the Oraons. According to some legends the Kherwars were the original settlers in the hilly tracts near Rohtas. The Oraons also claim 
 that they ruled over the area between Rohtas and Patna. The local legend also connects king Sahasrabahu with Sasaram, the headquarter of Rohtas district. It is 
 believed that Sahasrabahu had terrible fight with Saint Parsuram, the legendary Brahmin Protector, as a result of which Sahasrabahu was killed. The term Sahasram 
 is supposed to have been derived from Sahasrabahu and Parsuram. Another legend connects the ROHTAS hill to Rohitashwa, son of Raja Harishchandra, a famous king who 
 was known for his piety and truthfulness.

<p id="f2">In mythological and historical views, Rohtas is important place in national level. The hilly region of Vindhya series is known as Kurush Kshetra in Vedic period 
that was famous for Rishi, Mantra, exhibitors and land of legends. The area of the Rohtas successively came under the ruler of Shail dynasty of central India and 
Pal dynasty of Bengal. After the fall of the Guptas, Rohtas in all probability relapsed into the hands of the aboriginal tribes and came under the control of petty
chiefs. Rajputs who came from Ujjain and the province of Mallwa has a series of conflicts with the aboriginals and took them many hundred years to subdue the aboriginal
completely. A hundred years later, it passed under the direct control of Muslim empire of Delhi. Later on after different ruiling it came in hand of British.

 
<p id="f3">When Babar died , Sher Shah become active again. In 1537 Humayun advanced against him and he seized his fortresses at Chunar and Rohtas Garh. 
The district had a very uneventful history till we come to 1857 when Kunwar Singh revolted against the British Empire in line with the Mutineers of 1857.
Most of the heroic details of Kunwar Singh is concerned with the present district of Bhojpur. However he mutiny had its impact and produced similar up-rising and 
incidents here and there. The hilly tracts of the district offered natural escape to the fugitives of the Mutiny. During Independence movement the district had a 
substantiates contribution to the freedom movement of India. After independence Rohtas remained a part of the Shahabad District but on 10th November 1972 Rohtas 
became a separate District.

<p id="f4">Tourist Attractions in Rohtas are: Rohtasgarh Fort, Rohtasan Devi Temple, Chaurasan Shiv Mandir, Ganesha Temple, Bawan Talab, Diwan-E-Aam, Diwan-E-Khas, 
Hanging House, Tomb of Malik Wishal Khan(Akbarpur), Surya Narayana Temple, Kashis Waterfall.
