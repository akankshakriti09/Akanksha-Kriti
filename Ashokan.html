	  who have constructed a small wall in front portion of the rock shelter for fixing an iron gate.The rock shelter
	  is very small having a height of only three feet and its interior space can accommodate hardly two persons inside

	  community for quite longer period and they are applying lime coat/white washing regularly, with the result that
	  the inscription is getting invisible.The text of this inscription was published by A. Cunningham, Buhler, Senat
