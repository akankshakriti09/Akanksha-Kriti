    <div class="pRohtas1">
    <p id="f1">Rohtasgarh Fort is located in the southern region of Dehri about 40 km away on Kaimur range and it is 1500 m 
	above sea level. The founder of Rohtasgarh town was Rohitashva, son of the the great king Harishchandra. The 
	Rohtasgarh Fort is one of the most ancient forts in India. This tourist spot stands as a symbol of courage,
	strength and supremacy of the Sone valley.

	<div class="pRohtas2">
	<p id="f2">The Rohtasgarh fort itself has great places which capture the attention of tourists like Ganesha Temple,
	Elephant Gate, The Hanging House, Hathiya Pol or Elephant Gate, the Aaina Mahal, Habsh Khan Mausoleum, Jama 
	Masjid, Diwan-e-khas, Diwan-e-aam, Rohtasan Devi Temple, Chaurashan Mandir, Bawan Talab and Singh Dwar.
    Rohtasgarh is also well known for the waterfalls here that fall from Kaimur hill towards east and meet the 
	Sone river. Visiting Rohtasgarh means enjoying a lot of places and watching a lot of wonders. This serves as
	the most interesting destination for tourists.

	<p id="f3">Rohtasgarh Fort is one of the ancient forts of India which was constructed in the city of Rohtas situated on
	the banks of Sone river. The fort has been ruined and now cannot be accessed easily due to Naxalite activities.
	The hill on which the fort is situated has the height of 1500m. Tourists have to climb the stairs to reach the
	gate of the fort which is very exhausting.

	<div class="pRohtas2">
	<p id="f4">The Rohtas Fort is constructed on a plateau over the top of a hill with steeply rising sides. The steps 
	directing to the fort are cut into limestone of the hill. In the past, many streams crossed the plateau 
	and the soil was productive, which helped in easy growth of the crops, so that the inhabitants of the 
	fort could hold out for months against any enemy besieging the fort. Thick forests and wild animals 
	surrounded the hill providing natural barriers and dacoits provided other man-made barriers in the past.
	Thus the fort which was believed to be invincible, could not be taken by force but only by means of deceit.

	<div class="pRohtas1">
    <p id="f6">Rohtas is situated in an area where summer season is very hot and winter is very cold. The best time to visit
	the fort is from October to March as the climate is very pleasant during these months. Although January is very 
	chilly but still people will enjoy visiting the fort. If the tourists want to enjoy waterfall then they can come
	in monsoon though the climate is very hot and humid at this time.

	<h5 id="f7">Location</h5>
	<div class="pRohtas1">
	<p id="f8">It takes around two hours from the district headquarters at Sasaram to reach the foot of the hill over which 
	is the Rohtas Fort. The fort is situated at about 1500 feet above sea level. There are about 2000 odd limestone 
	steps at Medha Ghat meant for the most common mode of ascent to the fort on foot at present. For the visitor they
	are an exhausting climb of an hour and a half. At the end of the climb, one reaches the boundary wall of the fort.
	A lovely waterfall is seen during the rains, which falls over the fortifications, and is mesmerizing to watch and
	hear from a distance. A dilapidated gate with a cupola can be seen, which is first of several provided for well-
	guarded entrances to the fort. From here one has to walk another mile or so before the ruins of Rohtas can be seen.

                          <h4 id="f9">Rohtasgarh Fort - History</h4>
						  					  
    <h5 id="f10">Ancient History of Rohtasgarh Fort</h5>
	<div class="pRohtas1">
    <p id="f11">Some Historians say that the fort was built by Raja Harishchandra who belonged to Solar dynasty (Suryavansh Dynasty).
	He named the fort after his son’s name was Rohitashv.
	</div>
	<div class="pRohtas2">
	<p id="f12">In the Harivamsa Purana it is stated that Rohita, the son of Harishchandra, had Rohitpura constructed with a view 
	of consummation of his dominion. Even though the Fort is ascribed to have been constructed by the legendary Rohitaswa, 
	son of the great King Harish Chandra, there are no historical remains to corroborate the existence of early kings on 
	the fort. The oldest historical record found on the fort is an inscription which is ascribed to the 7th century, there 
	by implying the existence of the rule of Sasanka in the 7th century over Rohtas.

	</div>
	
	<div class="pRohtas2">
    <p id="f13">The legend of Harish Chandra, king of the solar race is well known. It is believed that his son Rohitaswa spent his
	time in exile from the kingdom at Rohtas, and also married a local tribal lady here. The Gazetteer records that “The 
	tradition that Rohtas was once the seat of their race lingers among the Kharwars, Oraons and the Cheros; the Kharwars
	call themselves suryavanshi and allege that, like Rohitaswa, they are descended from the Sun; while the Cheros claim 
	that they held the plateau till they sallied forth for the conquest of Palamu. Similarly, the Oraons assert that 
	Rohtasgarh originally belonged to their chiefs and was finally wrested from them by the Hindus who surprised them at 
	night during one of their great national festivals, when the men had fallen senseless from intoxication, and only women
	were left to fight.”

	<div class="Rohtas3">Pic 10: Rock inscription of Sasankadeva</div>
	</div>
	
    <div class="pRohtas3">	
	<p id="f15">About the oldest inscription from Rohtas, Dr. D R Patil has given details in his work “the Antiquarian Remains of
	Bihar”  as follows “ the exact location of the inscription on the hillis not given by Fleet, who noticed it earliest
	in his well knownwork on Gupta inscriptions. The inscription is in reverse on the rock and the whole, perhaps, according
	to Fleet, represents a mould or matrix for casting copper seals in relief. The seal matrixis circular in shape, 4 1/4” 
	inches in diameter, and has, in its upper smaller half a damaged figure of a recumbent bull facing to the right. In the 
	lower bigger half is the inscription in Sanskrit, in two lines, which reads Sri-maha samanta Sasanka-devasya. Fleet’s 
	suggestion that the Sasanka of Bengal who killed Rajyavardhana, the elder brother of King Harsha of Kannauj, is generally 
	accepted. He assigned the inscription palaeographically to 7th century AD.”
    </div>
	
	<div class="pRohtas2">
    <p id="f16">The only records of Hindu times connected with Rohtasgarh are a few rock cut inscriptions at various places on the plateau.
	The first at Phulwari, dates back to 1169 AD, and refers to the construction of a road up the hill by Pratapdhavala, the 
	Nayak of Japila. Japila is evidently the modern Japla, on the opposite side of the Sone, in the district of Palamu; and 
	Pratapdhaval appears to have been a local chief, who is also known from the inscrioptions at Tarachandi near Sasaram and 
	at Tutla Bhawani near Tilothu. From another inscription at Rohtas, Pratapdhawal is referred to belong to the Khayaravalavansha,
	which survives in the present day as the tribe of Kharwars. The only other record of Hindu Rule over the Fort is an inscription 
	at Lal Darwaza, dated 1223 AD, which mentions a descendant and successor of Pratapdhavala, called him like Pratapa.

    <h5 id="f17">Rohtasgarh Fort under Khayaravala Dynasty</h5>
	<div class="pRohtas1">
    <p id="f18">Rohtasgarh Fort was under the rule of Shri Pratapa during 1223CE. There is an inscription found in the fort
	which tells that Pratapa defeated the Yavana army and captured the fort. As per the inscription, the historians
	concluded that Pratapa belonged to Khayaravala dynasty.
	</div>
	<div class="pRohtas2">
    <p id="f19">The Hindu kings who succeeded Khayaravala dynasty built a road to the fort and built four gates on four ghats. 
	One gate can be seen at Raja ghat and one can be seen at Kathauthiya ghat. Other inscriptions state that the fort
	belonged to Sher Shah Suri.
	</div>
	
	<h5 id="f20">Rohtasgarh Fort under Sher Shah Suri</h5>
	<div class="pRohtas1">
    <p id="f21">Sher Shah Suri captured the fort in 1539 and he did so because he lost Chunar fort during a war with Humayun.
	Sher Shah told Raja Hari Krishan Rai, the ruler of Rohtas, that he wanted to keep his treasure and women in the 
	fort’s safety. He brought his women and children in palanquins but later on the palanquins that arrived have Afghan
	soldiers inside who captured the fort.
	</div>
	<div class="pRohtas2">
    <p id="f22">The king of Rohtas fled from the kingdom. During the reign of Sher Shah Suri, Jama Masjid was constructed by
	Haibat Khan in 1543. There are three domes in the mosque and the whole mosque was built of white sandstone.
	</div>
	
	<h5 id="f23">Rohtasgarh Fort under Raja Man Singh</h5>
	<div class="pRohtas1">
    <p id="f24">Raja Man Singh was a general of Emperor Akbar who ruled Rohtas from 1558 onwards. Rohtasgarh Fort was inaccessible
	and also was a place to look after Bengal and Bihar easily. So being the governor of those places, Man Singh made the
	fort his headquarters. He made improvements in the fort and built a palace for himself.
	</div>
	
	<h5 id="f25">Rohtas during later Mughals</h5>
	<div class="pRohtas1">
	<p id="f26">After the death of Man Singh, the fort came under the jurisdiction of the office of the Emperor's wazir from where 
	the governors were appointed. In 1621 AD, the Prince Khurram revolted against his father Jahangir and took refuge at
	Rohtas. The guardian of the fort, Saiyyad Mubarak handed over the keys of Rohtas to the prince. Khurram once again came
	to Rohtas for safety when he tried to win Avadh, but lost the battle of Kampat. His son Murad Baksh was born to his wife
	Mumtaz Mahal. During Aurangzeb's reign the fort was used as a detention camp for those under trial and housing prisoners 
	sentenced for life.
	</div>
	
	<h5 id="f27">Rohtasgarh Fort under British</h5>
	<div class="pRohtas1">
    <p id="f28">The fort came under the rule of British when they defeated Mir Kasim, the nawab of Bengal. The Nawab came to take 
	refuge in the fort but could not hide. Shahmal, the diwan of the fort gave the keys to the British Captain Goddard who
	destroyed many structures in the fort.
	</div>
	<div class="pRohtas2">
    <p id="f29">He left the fort after two months and put two guards to guard the fort. The guards also left the fort after one year
	and the fort was left in peace for the next 100 years. During the war of 1857, Amar Singh took refuge in the fort. There
	were many clashes between him and the British who finally won.
	</div>
	<div class="pRohtas2">
	<p id="f30">In 1763 AD, in the Battle of Udhwa Nala, the Nawab of Bihar and Bengal, Mir Kasim, lost to the British and fled with 
	his family to Rohtas. But he was not able to hide at the fort. Finally the Diwan of Rohtas, Shahmal handed it over to the
	British Captain Goddard. During his two-month stay at the fort, the Captain destroyed the storeroom and many of the
	fortifications. Goddard left, keeping some guards in charge of the fort, but they too left after a year.
	</div>
    <div class="pRohtas2">
    <p id="f31">There was peace at the fort for the next 100 years or so, which was at last broken at the time of the First War of
	independence in 1857. Amar Singh, the brother of Kunwar Singh, together with his companions took refuge here. There were
	many encounters with the British where the latter were at a disadvantage, for the jungles and the tribals in them were of
	great help to the Indian soldiers. Finally, after a long drawn out military blockade and many clashes, the British overcame
	the Indians.
	</div>
	<div class="pRohtas1">
    <p id="f32">The Fort thereafter lied neglected and was forgotten by the mainstream tourists.This fort also used to serve as a safety
	shelter for treasures as well as families of Shah Jahan, Maan Singh, Mir Qasim, and Sher Shah Suri. It was considered, that 
	this fort used to have 84 passages to the hill along with 14 main gate entries, 10 of which were later closed by Sher Shah 
	Suri.

	<p id="f57">The most picturesquely situated of all these temples is the Rohtasan, or the temple of Rohitaswa. It stands on the edge 
	of the precipice on a small peak at the north-eastern corner of the plateauand is approached by a long flight of eighty four
	steps; little of this temple now remains and the tower and mandapa which once formed part of it have long since disappeared.
	The image of Rohitaswa is said to have been worshipped here until it was destroyed by the iconoclastic zeal of Aurangzib,
	who erected a small brick mosque just behind it : the latter was a wretched building which has recently been demolished.
	Close by the temple of Rohitaswa stands the shrine sacred to his father Harish Chandra, a graceful building consisting of a
	small pillared hall covered with five domes, the image formerly worshipped here was also removed by Aurangzeb.
