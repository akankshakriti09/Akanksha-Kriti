	Khan Suri and Hasan Khan Suri came to India. The well courageous and brave Pathans were granted jaigirdari or

	<div class="pHasan3">
    <p id="f4">Famous places in Sasaram Places to visit in Sasaram. The fortune of Hasan Shah Suri turned good as he moved to Bihar.
 	The history of the Afghan Pathan started from that point. Hasan Shah Suri was the son of Ibrahim Khan Suri. He was 
	under regime of Baharol Shah Lodi. Hasan Shah Suri however became faithful to Sikandar Lodi. Sasaram Parganah was 
	given to the great leader and brave warrior from where he used to give directions. However things turned ugly when 
	the Mughals invaded India and Ibrahim Lodi was defeated in the First battle of Panipat in 1526. Babar came to the
	power. He was later killed in the battle of Kalinjar. The tomb was most probably built during the reign of his son
	Sher Shah Suri and completed somewhere around 1550 under Islam Shah, his grandson. The Tomb of Hasan Shah Suri was
	built closer to the tomb of Sher Shah.</div>

    <h5 id="f5">Architecture of Tomb of Hasan Khan Suri</h5>
    <div class="pHasan4">
    <p id="f6">Like other structures built during the time of Suri Dynasty, the Tomb of Hasan Shah Suri also has the typical
	Indo-Islamic influence. The Afghan reflection on the structure can be easily felt and seen. The historian says 
	that this one of the finest structures made during that time. It is believed that the establishment was started 
	at around 1535. It was built by Alawal Khan who later designed and has built the Tomb of Sher Shah Suri. The two 
	tombs of Father Hasan Khan Suri and son Sher Shah Suri are distanced for around 500 meters. The tomb is built in
	a square enclosure. The tomb has a grand main gate which is also the only way to enter into the tomb. The dexterity
	at the gate depicts the Afghan style. However, the tomb gets more beautified with the blend of Indian style along 
	with the Islamic style of architecture. The old monument is one of the many tombs in the Sasaram city.
	These tombs were built under the genius of Alawal Khan, the master architect. He was first commissioned to erect 
	the tomb of Hasan Khan in 1535. A high compound wall encloses Hasan’s mausoleum with gateways on its sides and 
	domed turrets at the corners. Attached to the tomb is the flat roofed prayer hall and madarsa. There is no plinth. 
	The main tomb consists of a large octagonal tomb chamber surrounded by a wide verandah on all the sides. On each 
	of the eight sides, the verandah is provided with three arched openings and three corresponding domes above it.
	The main tomb chamber rises higher than the domed roofs of the verandah and supports the larger central dome.
	Within the tomb chamber there are 25 graves, including that of Hasan Khan Suri in the center. The middle story
	of the monument appears to have been executed hurriedly with just bare walls instead of the kiosks and jalis.
