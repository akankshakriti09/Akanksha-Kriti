    <p id="f1">The Gurdwara Chacha Phaggu Mal marking the site of the old masand's house where the Guru stayed. This is 
	the principal Gurdwara of the town housed in a spacious high-ceilinged hall with a gallery at mid-height. 
	Three copies of Guru Granth Sahib are seated side by side under a domed rectangular pavilion of white marble.

	<div class="pChacha2">
	<p id="f2">Gurudwara Sri Chacha Phagu Mal Sahib is situated in Sasaram Town, Dist Rohtas Bihar. Bhai Phaggu Mall 
	(also known as Chacha Phaggu Mall) - a Gurmukh, Masand and Devout of Gurughar, was a follower of Guru Amar Das.
	To spread the message of Sikhism Guru Amar Das as a signature sent Manji's (Bed's) to different direction of the 
	world from Goindwal Sahib. Out of them one Manji was sent to Sasaram, Bihar through Bhai Phaggu Mal ji. Once Phaggu 
	mal ji reached Bihar, he stayed there for rest of his life and became the care taker of this location which 
	was adopted to preach Sikhism. 
	</div>
	
	<div class="pChacha3">
	<p id="f3">There is a significant memory associated with Sikh history in Sasaram. In the jani market of the city is the historical 
	Gurudwara Chacha Faggulal , where 9th Guru Teghbahadur Ji of the Sikhs lived for 21 days and got the supporters happy 
	with their blessings. But no plaque was given to the Sasaram railway station giving information about this historic 
	gurdwara. The distance of this Gurudwara to the railway station is just two kilometers. However the way to go
	is through narrow streets. The devotees can reach the Jani Market through the Dharamshala Road of the city to Gola and 
	then the Navaratna market or even from post office chowk through Lashkari Ganj to Jani Market.

	gurudwara of Arshad Sahib , Chacha Phaggumal Khadau and Naam Simarni Mala, which were presented to the accompanist. There 
	are 76 beads in this garland .

	<p id="f6">During his stay, he used to collect all the offerings (Chadaava) that Devotes used to donate and submit it to the
	Guru Sahib on his regular visits to them. He continued this practice with 6 different Guru Sahib's. Bhai Phaggu Mal
	Ji was the second person in the sikh history (After Baba Budha Ji Sahib) who had met and took blessing of Six Guru 
	Sahib's (Guru Amar Das to Guru Tegh Bahadur). However, once Bhai Phagu Mal became old he couldn't travel and prayed
	for Guru Ji to visit him one last time before he re-joined with God.
    <p id="f7">In his old age, Bhai Phaggu Mal Ji used to meditate and pray a lot to see Guru Sahib live as he felt that he
	is too old and cannot travel now. On this when Sri Tegh Bahadur ji went on tour in the east direction he heard Bhai
	Phagu Mal's prayers and decided to see him and went to his house personally. When Guru Sahib reached his home, Bhai
	Phaggu Mal Ji was lying on bed. Someone told him that Guru Sahib had come. Bhai Sahib said if there is Guru Sahib 
	then he don't need my permission. A small door opened (That door is still preserved in Gurudwara Sahib) and Guru 
	Sahib entered the room where Bhai Sahib was lying. Guru Sahib addressed Bhai Phaggu Mal Ji as "Chacha Phaggu Mal Ji".
	Phaggu Mall himself received Guru Sahib, his family and congregation with charm and did selfless service, during 
	thier stay at Sasaram. Bhai Phaggu Mal was overjoyed and took personal care of Guru Ji with his family and the Sangat 
	during the Guru's stay at Sasaram.

	<h5 id="f10">Ninth Sikh Guru Tez Bahadur stays 21 days in Sasaram</h5>
	<div class="pChacha6">
	<p id="f11">It is said that the sum of nine fund houses resides in the Suman of Ninth Deodhahi Guru Teghbahadur. The people of 
	Sasaram were blessed, who received the blessings of the sheet of Ninth Patshahi of Hind for many days. In the year 
	1666 , Guru Teghbahadur came out on his sadness (journey) with the east of the Lashkar. During this visit, he was on
	a visit to Kashi from Patiala by giving a message of 'japa' and 'wand chhicha'.
	During this he stayed for 21 days in Sasaram . Here he stayed in the cottage of Nanaka Shahi Chacha Faggulal. He was
	accompanied by his mother Nanaki , his Dharmapati mother Gujari and wife Bhrata Baba Kripal Chand.
    <p id="f12">Apart from making this historic city holy, the Ninth Patshahi also did many compositions while staying there. Here, 
	the chant Jajayvanti Mahla , the voice of Dhoom , Ram Sumari Ram Sumuri is your keji , Maaya is called Sarani Tiagu 
	Prabhu's Sarani , Jagat Sukh Manu Mithiya Jhooto Sabasuju. The Guruvani was of Bakshish. The discussion is glorious
	on the 1352 pages of Guru Granth Sahib .

    <p id="f13">Confirmation of these historical facts is also in the cult certified texts Suraj Prakash and Tawarik Guru Khalsa. This 
	has been done in Gurunak Dev Dev University Amritsar and Punjabi University Patiala.
	
	<p id="f14">Chacha Phaggumal was a non-Sikh saint who came to Bihar to campaign for the cult from Phagwara of Punjab. After that, they 
	 remained here. When Nava Guru Teghbahadur came to Sasaram, Chacha Phaggumal felicitated him. This historic gurus of Sasaram
	 have many memories related to the ninth polity.
