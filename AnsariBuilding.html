   <h7>Ruins of Abdul Qaiyum Ansari Haveli</h7>
</div>

   <div class="pAnsari1">
   <p id="f1">Nobody knows hardly in entire Rohtas district,the'Shafiya Miskin', a haveli located in Dehri-On-Sone of the great
   freedom fighter and former Minister Abdul Qaiyum Ansari. The haveli of Abdul Qaiyum Ansari is located in Tarbungla of 
   Dehri-On-Sone opposite to Dehri High School. It is known as Ansari Building by locals. It is hardly known to the new 
   generation that during the time of British rule, this mansion creates how much conspiracy against British rule and give
   shelter to the freedom fighters. 
   </div>

   <div class="Ansari1">Pic 1: Ruins of Abdul Qaiyum Ansari Haveli</div>
   </div>
   
   <div class="pAnsari2">
   <p id="f2">After the independence, the people named 'Shafiya Miskin' built on the land of 20 katha. Perhaps this was the conspiracy 
   of 'Azad India' that state has forced Abdul Qaiyum Ansari to rule only the Ansari community. There is no time to peep 
   towards this mansion that is becoming a ruin between all these states.
   </div>
   
   <div class="pAnsari3">
   <p id="f3">Khalid Ansari, son of Abdul Qaiyum Ansari, says that this building was made in 1913-14 by Abdul Waqf Ansari, the father
   of my grandfather, Abdul Qaiyum Ansari. It has its own history. The government has taken this legacy from us. Although we 
   also give money on the wages, but the government is acting negligent rather than looking after this legacy. All the 
   window-doors have been removed from here. The administration is not ready to hear. Let's say that the family of Abdul 
   Qaiyum Ansari now lives in Patna City.
   </div>

   <div class="pAnsari4">
   <p id="f4">Javed Ansari, who lives in Dehri, points out that he used to be very beautiful at some point of time. I have seen myself
   with my own eyes, this mansion. The beautiful chandeliers were engaged in the hall above. Many flower plants were planted 
   in the surrounding lands. But seeing today, it seems that a deserted man has taken his place. It seems really surprising 
   that the legacy of such a large freedom fighter has come in this situation.
   </div>
   
   <div class="pAnsari4">
   <p id="f5">Laddan Mian says, the situation of the building happnens like this by not paying attention to the government and family
   members. At some point earlier it was called gambling and liquor habit, but now at present there are some soldiers of the
   local police administration and the Home Guards are staying here.
   </div>
  
   <div class="pAnsari4">
   <p id="f6">The outer part of this building is being used to stand the vechile seized by police and some parts are occupied by Nomads. 
   They live here in slums. Goraki Devi, who lives in these slums says that there is no place for our living so we are living
   here. From here if the slum will go away we will have to go somewhere else. Who gave you permission to stay here? On this 
   question she says that we are living here with the permission of DIG Sahib. Apart from this he was not ready to tell anything.
   </div>
  
   <h5 id="f7">About Abdul Qaiyum Ansari</h5>
   
   <div class="pAnsari4">
   <p id="f8">Abdul Qum Ansari was such a leader who had strongly opposed the two-nation theory of Mohammad Jinnah and the partition of 
   India-Pakistan. Through all India's 'Momin Conference', he associated the entire Ansari community with the independence movement
   and stopped Hindustan from leaving Pakistan without considering India as its own country.

   <div class="pAnsari4">
   <p id="f9">He was born on July 1, 1905 in Dehri-on-Sone, Bihar. He was born in a rich Momin (Ansari) family. After studying in Sasaram
   and Dehri-on-Sone High School, he went to attend Aligarh Muslim University, Calcutta University and Allahabad University. Though 
   his education was interrupted due to his active involvement for India's independence. 
   </div>
   
   <div class="pAnsari4">
   <p id="f10">He was studying in Government run school at his hometown Dehri-on-Sone in Bihar. But his principles did not allow him to study
   in government school. He was involved in India's freedom struggle at the very young age and as a part of that he left government
   school in his hometown. He established a national school for the students who boycott the government schools in response to 
   Non-Cooperation and Khilafat Movements.  For this, he was arrested at the age of 16 and imprisoned in jail because he was involved
   in non-cooperation and Khilafat movements. 
   </div>
   
   <div class="pAnsari4">
   <p id="f11">Abdul Qayyum Ansari was also an accomplished journalist, writer and poet. He was the editor of Urdu Weekly "Al Islah" 
   (Correction) and an Urdu monthly "Musawat" (Samata) in the pre-weekly days.
