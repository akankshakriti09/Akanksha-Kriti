    <p id="f1">The Dalmia Group of companies traces its origins to Ramkrishna Dalmia and Jaidayal Dalmia. The two Marwari
	brothers were born in the present-day Rajasthan; the name Dalmia comes from the name of their ancestral village
	in present-day Haryana. The Dalmias established a group of businesses in East India during the first half of the 
	20th century. These businesses included a sugar mill in Danapur and a commodity trading business in Calcutta. In
	1932, Ramkrishna Dalmia's daughter married Shanti Prasad Jain of the wealthy Sahu Jain Family. Subsequently, Shanti
	Prasad and the Dalmia brothers worked together to expand the business,resulting in the formation of the Dalmia-Jain
	Group. By the end of 1940, the group was operating several sugar mills, cement plants, chemical factories, engineering
	plants and a paper mill.

	<div class="pDalmia2">
	<p id="f2">Shanti Prasad Jain took over Rohtas Industries Ltd. from his father-in-law, and under his stewardship, Dalmianagar 
	developed into a massive industrial town from the 1940s till the 1980s with factories producing sugar, cement, paper,
	chemicals, vanaspati, etc. employing top professionals of the country. Dalmianagar boasted of vast housing colony, 
	gardens, clubs, schools, market complexes, and hospitals for its employees. Rohtas Industries had their own private 
	aircraft in those days and a small air-field near Dalmianagar.
	</div>

	<div class="pDalmia3">
    <p id="f3">The prosperity of Dalmianagar started to decline in the mid 1970s as the law and order situation in this industrial
	town began to worsen. Local mafia indulged in dacoity and kidnapping. Slowly, executives and professionals began to
	leave and the factories were mismanaged. By the mid 1980s factories started to shut down. Massive electricity bills 
	remained unpaid by Rohtas Industries Ltd. to the State Electricity Board. There were irregularities in payment of 
	salaries and wages to employees. By the 1990s Dalmianagar looked like a ghost town.

   </div>

   <div class="pDalmia3">

   <p id="f12">An industrialist Ramkrishna Dalmia had established Dalmiaganar as an industrial town in the 20th century. His family members 
   had installed several plants manufacturing sugar, cement, paper, chemicals, banaspati (vegetable) oil and other units scattered
   over an area of 219 acres at Dalmianagar under the banner of Rohtas Industries Limited. 
   </div>

   <div class="pDalmia3">
   <p id="f13">But Rohtas Industries Limited started losing its glory gradually after 1980 and the company closed down completely by 1990 
   due to poor law and order situation and other factors. The charm of industrial town was also lost in the process.
   </div>

   <div class="pDalmia3">
   <p id="f14">Later, the Centre had given the responsibility of setting up a railway factory at Dalmianagar to Rites Limited, starting 
   with the sale of factory scraps.
