    <div class="pChaurashan1">
    <p id="f1">The Chaurashan Shiv Mandir are located almost a mile towards the northeast of the Rohtasgarh palace. The Chaurashan Mandir is situated a mile to the 
	North-East of the Man Singh's Palace.  The temple is dedicated Lord Shiva. Iconoclasts probably destroyed the roof and the main mandap, which contained
	the sacred lingam. The idol of the deity is missing from here even, but the rest of the construction is still in good condition.  Presently, there are
	just 84 steps are left, which pave way to the temple built by King Harishchandra. In local language, it is also called as "Chourasan Siddhi" because of
	its 84 steps.

	<p id="f2">Chaurasan Temple is located near the Rohtasgarh Fort in Sasaram. The ancient temple is believed to be established by the legendary Hindu King Harish 
	Chandra. Devoted to Lord Shiva, the ancient temple is famous for its dexterity and religious importance. The temple is one of the oldest temples of the
	country. The devotees from around the country and the world visit the holy place for worshipping. Regardless of the season and time, the Chaurasan Temple
	witness huge crowd. The festival and the puja during the time Mahashivaratri is considered as one of the best in the country. Many devotees reach the
	temple to worship the Lord of the Lords, Shiva. There is some believe among the local people that has made the temple even more famous. The local people
	believe that all wishes prayed at the ancient temple of Chaurasan come true. Due to the old age of the temple, it has started decaying in recent times.
	However, sighting the religious importance, concerned authorities have started discussing to revamp and maintain the temple to keep the glory of the 
	temple alive.

	<div class="pChaurashan2">
	<p id="f3">The most picturesquely situated of all these temples is the Rohtasan, or the temple of Rohitaswa. It stands on the edge of the precipice on a small 
	peak at the north-eastern corner of the plateauand is approached by a long flight of eighty four steps; little of this temple now remains and the tower 
	and mandapa which once formed part of it have long since disappeared. The image of Rohitaswa is said to have been worshipped here until it was destroyed 
	by the iconoclastic zeal of Aurangzib, who erected a small brick mosque just behind it : the latter was a wretched building which has recently been demolished.
	Close by the temple of Rohitaswa stands the shrine sacred to his father Harish Chandra, a graceful building consisting of a small pillared hall covered with 
	five domes, the image formerly worshipped here was also removed by Aurangzeb.
