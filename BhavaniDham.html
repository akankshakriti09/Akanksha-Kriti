   entertainment, besides the theater of the circus, Bhikari Thakur. But since 1990 the fall in the form of the fair began, which is towards
   the end of today. Now there are only a dozen small shops in the name of the fair.

   Shaktipeeth, points out that many times in the night, there has been an impression of mother's variance. Many times there are signs of 
   inauspicious events that occur in the surrounding area. Many people from the crowd of devotees who took the annual Navratri on this occasion 
   said that a desire to be fulfilled is definitely fulfilled. By the way, Balmiki Ramayan and the subsequent Shahabad Gajetian have also been 
   found in Yakshini Bhavani, which is presently located in Bhaluni Dham of Natwar Thana area, about 45 km from the district headquarters Sasaram.

   of the rustic gardens situated around the Dham. Nor do they harm the villagers and the farmers. It is believed that there is a special grace
   of Yakshini Bhavani on the devotees who have given food to the monkeys here. This is the reason that there are many grains and fruits and
   flowers along with the devotees coming there, along with the offerings.
